# Config

This directory contains all of the containerized integrations that have been developed to work within the fieldsets-pipeline infrastructure. Most of the directories found here are submodules with the exception of the `pipeline` and `docker` directories. The repository submodules cloned here have the necessary config files for our docker containers and simply require changing the `CONFIG_PATH` environment variable of the submodule to be `./config/${DIR}/`. Often this directory is maintained by a sys ops dev and each of these directories should be their own repository and included in `.gitmodules`\. If this approach is taken, it makes sense that each `Dockerfile` is configured to be able to run without the top level compose file we use to run the fieldsets-pipeline.
