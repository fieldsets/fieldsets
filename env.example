# Remote Data Sources
#   For Working locally, the below integrations have been setup as postgres foreign data servers
#   This works by setting up tunnels via a fieldsets jump server. As only one jump server is permitted with SSH_HOST, this means you cannot access staging and production servers simultaneously.
#   It is recommended to use a read only user account for the foreign data servers and copy any data you need into your local DB.
