# Fieldsets Local Binary Scripts

This directory contains local utility scripts to execute applications within the containers instantiated by this pipeline. These scripts should have no requirements on the developers local environment other than being run using via a standard linux shell and should execute within running containers.

For your local environment, you may want to add this directory to your `$PATH` environment variable.
